# CSC120-FinalProject

## Deliverables:
 - Your final codebase
 - Your revised annotated architecture diagram
 - Design justification (including a brief discussion of at least one alternative you considered)

We thought about doing a totally discovering (open) game and allowing people to try to type things and see if they can figure out what to type, but that doesn't seems playable to us, so we used the method of fixed ways to play the game and can make sure less unexpected happens. 

 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 
We used Object oriented programing to set up three classes one for Bag class which is a aggregation (part of ) the human class and a Room class that have the map to record the coordinates that is associated with the Human class we set up and main method to deal with the text based game and use the methods from the Human class and the other two classes.
 
 The overall approach we did is start from designing the structures, try write codes, adjusts codes. Our principle is the S^4 method mostly. We've started small, which we concidered about how to write a code about excaping a room and players met something on the way and use them. Then, we tried to enrich the contents of the methods and contents of "surprising things" in the room. After we got some simple tries successfully compiled, we tried to add more things to make it complete and more interesting. Finally, we ended with what our target is (approximately yes!).
 
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 
 The easier way of doing if else statements and also to actually implementing association of classes
 
 There are quite a lot of things I learned and got familiar with in this project. I have learned some new coding methods such as the switch method, which helps me diminish repeating works, and makes the codebase clearer and more aesthetic as well. In addition, I have figured out the importance making clear constructions before writing the code, which in this project is reflected from the archetecture diagram. These simple boxes truly provides a clear mind.
 
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 
 If we have more time and practice, we could even do a limited steps game and more text based background info about the game.  
 
 If I had a chance, I would like to construct a real map showing path the player has truly passed by. This is how I was inspired by a classmate's work. Through my classmates' attempts, I found that some of my classmates have been struggled and got lost in the "room", which it seems they have forgot the way they travelled. A map showing which path they have been to previously would largely help reduce this stressful feeling and improve players' experience.
 
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?

For the map we could also check if we have been there. Also giving hints for every coordinate. Maybe we could make it into a actual interface or visualization rather than just running it in VS Code. 
 
 I would like to add some visualized icons or diagrams since these would make the text-based game more interesting. For example, while there is an apple found infront of the player, we only used a sentence telling that "the doctor gives a hint that...". If there is a bubble showing up and a figure of doctor is talking, that would make the game more impressive. And some animations could be exploited as well. For example, after the player found the way out, a cartoon caracter moving back and forwards on the screen would make the game more vivid and lively.
 
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?

The most helpful feedback I have received is from one of my classmate, Zhirou. She gave us some advice about how we can provide choices for players to choose but not receiving unexpected actions from the players. For example, while a player found an apply in front of her, we can provide default choices such as "grab, drop, and examine" for players to choose. If we do not provide options, we have to think of lots of different alternative words, even unexpected slangs, from players. I was so appreciated and used this method.
  
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?

I would say to limit imagination into small things which might be the reason we didn't complete the large thought of the game we initially imagined but a fine game. I think if we started just right we can be more focused and pay attention to the details.
 
 I would say "Please use some methods from previous works and not include new stuffs that are beyond your ability". I initially had great and complete ideas about the text-based program. However, while trying to write the code, I found I cannot express what I think at all. And there were even many classes unable to compile, which we gave up finally. It seems that we have a great plan at the beginning, but made it easier step by step. I wish I had a better and practical design before starting the project.
 In addition, another hint I would like to give myself is to work step by step. There is no way to make success in one step and it's easy to fail sometimes. I have been stressful and worried during the first and half week since I didn't know how I could write my inside thoughts out. What I am thinking is that just don't be afraid and try one step each time. You will find the way out very soon.
 
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.

I think we just wrote the code together and did every thinking step together and didn't like seperate and then bundle the codes we wrote seperately. It is inefficient but we got to know each other's ideas and better know what we wanted the game to be like and also can work together and ask her to help debug.
 
 We used to think we could clearly seperate our work evenly. However, the truth is that can never work. I have surprisingly found out people are specialized in different things while it's more efficient if we work together to make progress. Since at the same time we wrote codes, we talked and we got to know what is in each others' mind. In this way, we have made sure that we are in the same pace. This method might not work for mature programmer since that's inefficient. However, for people like us, who both only want to learn something about java but never expected the difficulty level, this method is extremely benefit.
 No matter what, we have been satisfied and proud of the outcomes in the final project. At least, for several players experienced in class, they look happy and seem to be surprised about what they found and how they approached the exit. With the hint, everyone found their way out. I believe this is one of the most meaningful things in final period.
