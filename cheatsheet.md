# Description of layout

The company X&A is carrying out people to test a game in a dimension you never had experienced -- inside the computer. 
This game is a escape room. You are trapped in this samll room that is filled with little surprises, even though you don't know where you should go, little surprises on the way like a apple might help you find the way from getting a hint from someone! The whom is for you to find out. There are other surprises in the room as well. For this time only, the company X&A has made room very generous for you all, we promise, even though you might be stuck for a long time, you can find the way out! HAHAHA, who knows if it is really you inside the room or what that escapes the room?! 

# SPOILER ALERT

If your game includes challenges that must be overcome to win, also list them below.

There are unlimited steps but the key and the exit are both not far from where you started with.
Good luck on finding the key and the EXIT. Little surprises on the way might help.
